- -.Come to class prepared to engage in class discussions and activities.



# Tutoring Resources:

Psychology tutoring will be held in 1A-108.  Please call 718-982-3962 for the schedule.  Additional tutoring will be held through Academic Support in the Library 1L-117.



# Additional Course Requirement: Research Participation Credits

The discipline of psychology utilizes the principles of scientific research to test its ideas. The faculty in the Department of Psychology believes that all students enrolled in PSY100 should experience the research process.  Therefore, all students are required to participate in a minimum of 4 half-hour units of research (research credits, RCs) to be accumulated throughout the semester. You will have a variety of options to fulfill the research participation requirements, including participation in laboratory experiments or surveys, attending psychology department research talks, and doing an on-line ethics course. **These must be completed by the last day of class or you will receive an incomplete.**



During the first two weeks of class **you will receive an email from Victoria Baker (** [**victoria.baker@csi.cuny.edu**](mailto:victoria.baker@csi.cuny.edu)**) with your login information from the Research Participation System.** Please go to the psychology department&#39;s home page **(website: http://csi-cuny.sona-systems.com/)** to sign up for RCs.  Under Current Students, you will see the words Research Credit Requirement. Click there to obtain guidelines on how to fulfill the requirement of 4 RCs. You MUST use your CSI email to access the sona system. **Those who do not fulfill the research credit requirement will be given an incomplete as their PSY100 grade.**

**This requirement should be completed as early in the semester as possible to avoid a grade of INC.  ** Unfortunately, if you wait until the end of the semester you may not be able to find time slots to complete your requirement and we cannot help you to avoid the inevitable INC.  This is a departmental requirement and cannot be waived by the instructor.



# Additional Course Requirement: Attendance and Participation

See &quot;Attendance Policy&quot; in Schedule of Classes, p. 23: &quot;A student who is absent in excess of 15% of the class hours in the semester is assigned a grade of WU (withdrew unofficially), subject to the discretion of the instructor. Fifteen percent equals six hours for a course that meets three hours a week.&quot; Please realize that this policy holds for excused and unexcused absences. It is your responsibility to be in class during the scheduled times.



# Grading:

Grades will be based on:

1. Blackboard discussion forum (15%)
2. Three multiple-choice exams (60%: 20% each)
3. Presentation on psychopathology (10%)
4. Study Guide writing assignments (10%)
5. Participation in class discussion (5%)

A: 92.5 and above  C+: 76.5 –79.4

 A–: 89.5 – 92.4  C: 69.5 –76.4

 B+: 86.5 – 89.4  D: 59.5 –69.4

 B: 82.5 – 86.4  F: 59.4 and below

 B–: 79.5 – 82.4

# Weekly Discussion Forum (on Blackboard):

Each week, one or two discussion questions will be posted to Blackboard as homework.  You will be required to post an answer to each question (often this will require you to watch a video prior to responding), and then post comments to at least two other students&#39; posts. **EACH WEEK&#39;S FORUM WILL CLOSE 24 HOURS PRIOR TO CLASS.**



# Exams:

All exams are closed book. Exams are 25 multiple-choice questions on what you have learned in the on-line homework and through class activities. All material in the assigned textbook chapters is testable. **Each exam will last 35 minutes; In-class activities will resume after each exam.  You are required to attend class after you finish your exam!  ** EXAM GRADES WILL NOT BE CURVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE; THIS CONSTITUTES GRADE INFLATION AND IS IN VIOLATION OF DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY POLICIES.

**Make-up exams:** students who miss one exam may take an optional cumulative final exam on the same day as Exam 3 (during finals week). **The cumulative final exam will cover material from Exams 1 and 2 only.** Students who miss two exams are automatically given a grade of &quot;WU&quot;.  Students who do not miss any exams will be allowed to take the cumulative final exam, with their lowest exam grade dropped.



# Group Presentations on Psychopathology:

Students will work in groups of 3-4 students to prepare mini-presentations on different forms of psychopathology from categories such as anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, feeding and eating disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, personality disorders, etc. **Students will be given a template to follow in preparing their group presentations; students are required to peer-evaluate their own presentations as well as those of their classmates.**

# **Policies for Dishonorable Conduct and Cheating:**

Familiarize yourself with CUNY policies regarding dishonorable conduct. No matter how mild or severe the cheating, it is entirely unacceptable, and I will enforce the current policies to the fullest extent.



# **Email Etiquette:**

If you do not include in the subject line &quot;PSY100&quot;, I may not read or respond to your email.  Please use complete sentences and check for spelling errors.  Please sign your full name so I know who you are. YOU MUST USE A CUNY EMAIL to access Blackboard, which is how I will be emailing you.

# Classroom Behavior:

Students are expected to behave appropriately during class. You may use the following principle to guide your classroom behavior: Your behavior should not be disruptive or distracting to the instructor or your classmates. This principle will help you determine appropriate classroom behaviors. The following list is not exhaustive.

1. Come to class on time. Your late entrance is distracting to everyone.

2. Stay for the entire class period. If you must leave early, sit near the exit and leave quietly.

3.        Silence your cellular phone prior to coming to class. **DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE DURING CLASS** unless you have an emergency situation that you explain me before class starts. In case you are caught using your phone repeatedly **3 POINTS OF YOUR FINAL GRADE** will be taken down.

5. Talk only when you have been given the floor. Talking with the people next to you is distracting to everyone. If you are asking your neighbor a question about the course, it is likely that everyone will benefit if you raise your hand and ask your question of the instructor.

6. Be attentive. You may not realize it but it is distracting to your instructor if you read a magazine in the back of the classroom or doze off during class. I cannot focus on the information I am trying to convey if I am worried that I am boring you.
